This technology, stored on blockchain platforms, has its roots in computer code, and its development is largely attributable to the expertise of **smart contract developers**. As these professionals become increasingly vital, there's a growing interest in understanding how to become one. This comprehensive guide explores what smart contracts are, what smart contract developers are, the intricacies of blockchain and Ethereum, an overview of smart contract languages, how to learn **Solidity**, setting up a **development environment**, common challenges, salary breakdown, and how to **hire a smart contract developer**. 


### What are Smart Contracts?

A smart contract is a **self-executing contract** with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts are stored on a [**blockchain**](fundamentals/blockchain-data-structure.md), making them **transparent** and **immutable**. **Proposed in 1994 by cryptographer Nick Szabo**, smart contracts have found widespread use in various industries, automating and securing transactions, and **minimizing the need for third-party intermediaries**.

Applications range from automating** KYC checks**, processing [**loan applications**](defi/crypto-lending.md), and **fraud detection** in financial services to tracking movement of goods and **triggering automatic payments** in supply chain management. 

### What is a Smart Contract Developer?

A **smart contract developer** is an individual skilled in **writing code for smart contracts** on blockchain platforms like [Ethereum](cryptocurrency/ethereum-glossary.md), Solana or Cosmos. Their work involves developing decentralized applications (dApps) using blockchain technology and **ensuring these applications run without fraud or third-party interference**. 

### Understanding Blockchain and Ethereum

A blockchain is a **secure**, **transparent**, and **tamper-proof distributed ledger** that stores data across multiple systems, thereby **minimizing the risk of data tampering**. The blockchain serving as the backbone of smart contracts in this context is Ethereum, a decentralized platform featuring its native programming language, Solidity, allowing developers to **build complex applications**.


### Ethereum Basics

Ethereum takes blockchain technology a step further by facilitating smart contracts, running applications exactly as programmed with no scope of fraud or third-party interference. Ethereum has its native programming language, Solidity, which allows developers to write smart contracts, making it the platform of choice for most smart contract developers.

## What You Need to Know To Become A Smart Contract Developer

Becoming a smart contract developer requires proficiency in both blockchain and Ethereum development, with an emphasis on **understanding the Solidity programming language**, which is predominantly used for **writing contracts on the Ethereum blockchain**.

### Different Types of Smart Contract languages 

Smart contract coding languages form the backbone of blockchain technology. These programming languages allow developers to create self-executing contracts that automatically enforce the terms of an agreement within a decentralized network. Here's a comparison of some of the **top smart contract languages as of 2023**:

1. [**Solidity**](https://soliditylang.org/): As the most popular language for the [**Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**](interoperability/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm.md), Solidity offers a high-level, **Turing-complete environment** that's relatively easy for developers familiar with JavaScript. Its robust protective measures and wide support in terms of libraries and tooling make it an excellent choice for **beginners in Web3 development**. However, for developers unfamiliar with object-oriented programming, Solidity's syntax may be challenging, and it does not natively support decimals. Furthermore, coding in Solidity could result in **higher gas costs** compared to lower-level languages.

2. [**Vyper**](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/): This is the second most widely used Web3 language for EVM-compatible blockchains. It boasts a **Python-like syntax**, making it a great choice for developers already familiar with Python. Its simplified language implementation enhances **code readability and auditability**, which helps in building secure smart contracts. However, **Vyper lacks some features found in Solidity**, including modifiers, class inheritance, and recursive calls, due to deliberate design choices aimed at maximizing contract security. As a **newer language**, it's still under development and may not offer as many features as more established languages.

3. [**Yul**](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html): This intermediate language supports the EVM and is designed to **optimize smart contracts** and **reduce gas costs**. It's most suitable for writing specific, performance-optimized code. However, as a standalone language, Yul lacks tooling and community support compared to languages like Solidity.

4. [**Cairo**](https://www.cairo-lang.org/): This Turing-complete language is primarily used for creating **STARK-provable programs** for general computation on **StarkNet**. While Cairo's program logic conversion to STARK proofs can be incredibly useful for scalable and fast smart contracts, it's predominantly unsupported outside the StarkNet/StarkEx ecosystem.

5. [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/): Rust is a powerful language used in **both Web3 and non-Web** development and is particularly popular for **non-EVM-compatible blockchains** like Polkadot and Solana. It's known for its efficiency, security, and compact data structures. However, many blockchains do not yet have complete tooling or robust support for Rust.

6. [**Move**](https://move-language.github.io/move/): Developed originally for the **Diem blockchain**, Move is a **Rust-based language** that places emphasis on first-class resources, improved safety, and upgrade verifiability. It is mostly used within the Aptos and Sui blockchains and is not widely supported outside these.

When choosing a smart contract programming language, it's important to consider the specific blockchain you're interested in developing for, as different blockchains support different languages. **For beginners uncertain about their blockchain of choice, Solidity and Vyper are excellent starting points** to explore how smart contracts work. 


### Learning Solidity 

Learning Solidity is a key step towards becoming a smart contract developer. There are multiple resources available to aid in this learning process:

**Online resources**: Blogs, articles, tutorials, and YouTube channels dedicated to teaching Solidity.
