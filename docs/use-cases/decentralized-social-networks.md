# Decentralized Social Networks

As social media continues to permeate every aspect of our daily lives, the need for more secure, private, and user-centric platforms has emerged. Decentralized social media or Web3 social networks, powered by blockchain technology, are offering innovative solutions to the challenges posed by traditional Web2 social networks such as privacy concerns, censorship, and monopolization. This article delves into the world of decentralized social media, exploring its unique features, the problems it addresses, how it operates, and the pros and cons of this emerging technology.
## What is Decentralized Social Media? 

Decentralized social media refers to a new wave of social networks that operate on a _decentralized model_, leveraging blockchain technology and independent servers instead of a centralized server that is under the control of a single entity. This emerging form of social networking aims to address the issues and concerns associated with traditional social media platforms, such as privacy concerns, monopolization, censorship, and regulatory oversight.

Traditional social media platforms, also referred to as Web2 social networks, have become an integral part of our everyday lives, with their ability to connect people, facilitate information exchange, and provide entertainment. They also offer businesses an effective tool to reach a wider audience and strengthen their online presence. However, these platforms are not without their challenges. Dominant companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube control a significant portion of the social media market and users' data, leading to criticisms over their power and influence. Moreover, **these platforms often face issues such as privacy concerns, censorship, and increased regulatory scrutiny**.

Decentralized social media, or Web3 social networks, offer potential solutions to these challenges. These networks allow users **more privacy and control over their data**, and promote transparency as anyone can view the data at any time. The decentralized nature of these networks ensures that there is no _central authority_ with the power to control or manipulate content, and no third party can own, collect, or sell user data. Furthermore, these networks use fungible and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) for user and content authentication. Content, such as articles or videos that are minted as an NFT can be traded and monetized on the platform. This is a marked shift from the advertising-driven and data-collection business models of traditional social media platforms.

## What are Decentralized social networks?

Decentralized social networks are built on platforms like [Ethereum](../cryptocurrency/ethereum-glossary.md) and offer alternatives to established social media services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Medium. These blockchain-powered networks have several features that distinguish them from their traditional counterparts, including **resistance to censorship** and **lack of centralized control**, making them potentially more appealing to users seeking a more secure and private social networking experience.
## What problems do Decentralized Social Networks solve? 

1. **Centralized Control and Censorship**: One of the main problems with current Web 2.0 social networks, such as Twitter or Facebook, is their centralized control. This means that a single authority can determine what is acceptable on the platform, leading to instances of de-platforming or censorship. Decentralized social networks aim to solve this problem by creating an environment where content is not controlled by a single entity. They leverage blockchain technologies like Ethereum to enable this decentralization.

2. **Limitations on Developer Creativity**: In traditional social networks, developers are bound by the terms of service of the platform and may not have complete freedom to innovate. In contrast, decentralized social networks aim to offer developers permissionless access to data and APIs, which could potentially lead to a broader range of applications and user experiences.

3. **User Sovereignty**: In current social networks, users do not _own_ their identities. They are merely leased from the platform provider. If the provider decides, for any reason, to revoke a user's account, the user loses their identity and all associated data. Decentralized social networks like Farcaster, as mentioned in the transcript, seek to address this issue by giving users ownership of their identities, which are secured on the blockchain. This feature enhances user autonomy and protects against sudden account closures.

4. **Data Composability**: The speaker also discusses the idea of a "Blended news feed" on Farcaster, which combines traditional social content with on-chain activities. This allows for a richer, more interactive social experience where users can engage with both on-chain and off-chain activities of the people they follow. 

5. **Assurances for Developers**: Decentralized social networks aim to provide assurances to developers that the structures they build will not be arbitrarily altered or removed. This stability can encourage long-term investment in application development, driving innovation and user engagement.

6. **Potential for Anonymity and Privacy**: Decentralized networks can potentially enable more sophisticated privacy protections. With every user having a working public and private key, end-to-end encryption becomes feasible. Moreover, with advancements in [zero-knowledge proofs](../privacy/zero-knowledge-proofs-zkp.md), users could assert credibility or make claims without revealing their identities.

## How do Decentralized social networks work? 

Decentralized social networks represent a significant shift in the way we engage and interact online. Unlike their traditional counterparts, such as Facebook and Twitter, which operate on centralized servers, decentralized social networks exist on [peer-to-peer systems](../fundamentals/p2p-networks.md) with **thousands of nodes globally**. This decentralization offers numerous benefits, including improved resistance to failures, increased user privacy, and an open-source framework that stimulates innovation.

### The Power of Decentralization

Traditional social networks rely on centralized databases to store user information and other data. While these centralized systems have been effective for many years, they have single _points of failure_ that can lead to significant outages, as witnessed in Facebook's infamous hours-long blackout last year.

On the contrary, decentralized social networks operate on a network of nodes spread across the globe. These networks are far more resilient, as they can continue to operate even if some nodes fail. This decentralized approach results in social platforms that are more robust, less prone to outages, and resistant to censorship.

### User Data: A Paradigm Shift

User data protection is another critical area where decentralized social networks excel. Traditional platforms often sell user information to advertisers, raising privacy concerns. With decentralized networks, however, user data is stored on systems like the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which offers superior protection against exploitation and malicious use. **In these networks, personal data is not a commodity to be sold, but a fundamental right to be protected**.

### Monetization Through Native Tokens

Unlike traditional social networks, where advertising revenue forms the backbone of monetization, decentralized platforms often utilize [native tokens](../tokenomics/what-is-a-token.md). Users can buy these tokens to unlock specific features, make in-app purchases, or tip their favorite content creators. This alternative monetization model provides a **cleaner and more user-friendly experience**, free from intrusive advertisements.

### Openness and Client-Centric Ecosystems

Decentralized social networks operate on an open model, allowing developers to build their applications, known as "clients," on top of the network's protocol. This openness stands in stark contrast to the closed systems of traditional social media platforms. In a decentralized network, the protocol provides an open design model or API, **granting developers freedom to innovate without restrictions**.

This client-centric approach means that the network can be accessed through multiple clients, each offering a unique user experience. Unlike the homogeneous experience provided by centralized networks like Facebook or Twitter, a decentralized network fosters a diverse ecosystem of apps catering to different audiences.

### Bootstrapping and Conversational Liquidity

For a decentralized social network to thrive, it needs to bootstrap the network by attracting a core group of users. This initial user base is essential for achieving "conversational liquidity," ensuring that there's always fresh content for users to engage with.

### Shared Layer of Identity and Data

In a decentralized network, users' identities and their public data—posts, likes, follows—are available on the network for other developers to use when they build new apps. This shared layer of data not only reduces the onboarding process for users but also encourages the growth of new social apps.

### Protocol-Centric Design

While the term "client-centric" emphasizes the importance of clients, the true value lies in the underlying protocol, like Farcaster in this case, that allows anyone to build a client on top of it. This protocol-centric design promotes a **diverse ecosystem of apps** and **encourages innovation**.

### The Interplay between Protocol and Clients

The relationship between the protocol and the clients is symbiotic. The protocol needs at least one robust client to attract users, and as more users join, more developers become interested in building clients. This creates a positive feedback loop that benefits the entire ecosystem, driving **growth and innovation**.
