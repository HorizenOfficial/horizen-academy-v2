## What are Altcoins?

The term **altcoin** stems from a combination of '_alternative_' and '_coin_' in the sense of cryptocurrency coins. 

**All cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin are referred to as altcoins in the crypto universe**. 

_Horizen's_ native currency _ZEN_ is an altcoin by that definition. 

_Bitcoin_ is open-source software and anybody is free to use the code for whatever purpose he likes. _Not surprisingly, the vast majority of altcoins are derived or forked from Bitcoin_.

_The first notable altcoin_, Namecoin, was based on the Bitcoin code. It kept the original maximum supply of _21 million_ in place and also didn't change the _Proof-of-Work algorithm_. It primarily diverged from Bitcoin in introducing user domains.

 Another early altcoin was _Litecoin_.

Litecoin raised the maximum supply to 84 million LTC. It kept the block reward from Bitcoin, but decreased the block time from _10_ to _2.5_ minutes. 

The same block reward issued _four times as often_ results in a _four-fold increase_ in total supply. 

The mining algorithm for Litecoin was also changed from _SHA256_ to _Script_.

## Why Create an Altcoin?

You might ask yourself why there are so many _altcoins_ or _cryptocurrencies_ out there. 

The main reason is that different people have different opinions about what the "ideal" cryptocurrency looks like. There are many parameters to tweak in a blockchain protocol. You can change the _total supply_, the _issuance schedule_, the _block creation time_ as well as _many other factors_.

In order to apply those changes to an existing project, you have to convince a majority of participants that these changes will benefit the blockchain and all participants. Few people have the mandate to suggest such changes, especially if they just joined a blockchain project and haven't built a reputation for improvements yet. 

_Changing a single parameter is difficult enough_ and takes a lot of time and consensus building. If you envision a blockchain with a bunch of changes applied to it, it is easier to clone the software and start a new project, instead of convincing the developer community to change the original codebase.

## The Cambrian Explosion of Cryptocurrencies

**It is a positive development to see such a large amount of different approaches to solving the same problem:** 

*Building a censorship-resistant, permissionless, and decentralized electronic cash system.* 

The development we have seen over the last years is similar to the _Cambrian Explosion_, an event, or better a time span, about 541 million years ago, during which a huge variety of life forms developed. 

This ultimately led to the diversity of life that we are seeing on earth today. Through natural selection, only the fittest species survived and evolved into the species still roaming the earth today.

_We might see a similar development in the crypto-space_. 

Right now there are many different implementations of the same idea being tested and the best functioning ones will most likely survive, while a lot of the "unfit" projects will go extinct. 

_This is a necessary development_. You cannot know for sure if an idea works if you haven't tried it out.

### Varying Types of Altcoins

 - Stablecoins
 - Utility Tokens
 - Memecoins
 - Governance Tokens
 - Security Tokens
 - Mining-based
 - Staking-based


## How to Research Altcoins

We want to show you where you can start looking at the different altcoins. 

Probably the most visited website in the crypto space is [*CoinMarketCap*](https://coinmarketcap.com/). 

It shows you the price of most cryptocurrencies and tokens out there, together with a bunch of other information such as links to their websites. They also let you look at historical price data and simple charts.

[CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) also has price data on various coins but also includes detailed information about each individual blockchain. From there you have a good starting point for additional research.
